# Thread Fields Structure Changes

## Summary

Modified the thread fields structure in the Plain n8n node to improve user experience by showing field names first instead of field types.

## Changes Made

### ThreadDescription.ts
- **Before**: User had to select field type first, then field name, then enter value
- **After**: User selects field name first, then the appropriate input field appears automatically based on the field type

### Key Improvements

1. **Field Name First**: Combined all field types (STRING, BOOL, ENUM) into a single dropdown showing field names with type indicators
2. **Auto-determined Type**: The field type is automatically determined from the selected field name
3. **Dynamic Input Fields**: The appropriate input field (text, boolean, dropdown) appears based on the selected field's type
4. **Better UX**: More intuitive workflow - users think in terms of field names, not types

### Technical Implementation

1. **Field Schema Encoding**: Field values are encoded as `{TYPE}_FIELD_{key}|{type}|{id}` (e.g., `STRING_FIELD_department|STRING|abc123`)
2. **Display Options**: Used regex patterns to show/hide input fields based on field type:
   - String fields: `fieldSchema: ['/STRING_FIELD_/']`
   - Boolean fields: `fieldSchema: ['/BOOL_FIELD_/']`
   - Enum fields: `fieldSchema: ['/ENUM_FIELD_/']`
3. **Field Processing**: Updated field processing logic to use `stringValue`, `booleanValue`, and `enumValue` instead of generic `fieldValue`

### Files Modified

- `/src/nodes/Plain/descriptions/ThreadDescription.ts` - Updated field structure for both create and update operations
- `/src/nodes/Plain/PlainNode.node.ts` - Updated field processing logic to handle new field value names

### User Experience Flow

1. User selects "Add Thread Field"
2. User sees dropdown with field names like:
   - "Department (Text)"
   - "Priority (Dropdown)"
   - "Is Urgent (True/False)"
3. User selects field name
4. Appropriate input field appears automatically:
   - Text input for string fields
   - True/False toggle for boolean fields
   - Dropdown with enum values for enum fields
5. User enters value and continues

This provides a much more natural workflow where users focus on what field they want to set rather than having to understand field types first.
